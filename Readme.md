## To run this project:
- Run the main.py file
- Enter desired entry for seeing account balance, transfer, or leaving
- If transfer: enter the desired wallets to transfer to/from and the amount. The transaction will take place
- The wallets with their respective balances are in the wallet.csv file
- The collection of transactions is in the ledger.txt file along with the miner_wallet.csv
- Wallet balances will update within the program, and proper hashing and blockchain management also takes place within the project
- To exit the program, in the main menu enter the third option
- Note: I had to change the miner.py file a bit to reach functionality. There was an endless loop error - but it works now with the minor change
